# Fun and interesting python projects
This repository contains some of my fun python projects apart from the Data Science projects that I have. The contents are as follows:

#### 1. Credit card validator
This project uses the Luhn algorithm to find out if the credit numberentered by the user is valid or not. If it is valid, then it also identifies which card company is it from using the MCC number. This is what many websites use to validate and identify cards that they support.


#### 2. IP Address location finder
This was a small attempt at finding out the house address or exact location of a person given their IP address. This uses the google maps API to find out their location through longitute and latitude points.


#### 3. A web based snake game
The plain old snake eating game in for a website in python which also tells us the user score below the display and prompts the user when they die. The controls are the arrow keys of a keyboard.
